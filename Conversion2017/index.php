<p>Our systems are upgrading April 29 - May 1.  See below for important details you should be aware of.</p>
<p><strong>Debit Cards will be in offline processing beginning April 29th after 3 pm.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>While debit cards are in offline processing, you will be able to make purchases. If you have any issues using your debit card during the weekend, we will be more than happy to assist you. Telephone support will be available Saturday and Sunday while the system is unavailable. Simply call 478- 745-0494. To avoid any NSF fees, please make sure you have an accurate record of your account balance at 3 p.m. on April 29th, and keep a register of any transactions you make throughout the weekend as backup.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mobile Banking, Online Banking and Timely Teller will be unavailable after 3 pm on April 29 until Monday, May 1.</strong><br>
  <strong>Timely Teller pins will change.  See below for instructions to access your information.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Your current Timely Teller pins will not convert to the new system. Once Timely Teller becomes available post-conversion, you will need to log in using your Member Account Number as the user and the last four digits of the primary account holder&rsquo;s SSN as the password. (Ex: User = 12345 and Password = 6789) Following your first log in, you must change your log in credentials.</li>
</ul>
<p>Online Banking and Mobile Banking log in ID and passwords will not covert over to the new system.  See below for details.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your current Online Banking log in ID and password will not convert over to the new system. Once Online Banking becomes available post-conversion, you will need to visit our website at www.cgrcu.org. Next, you need to click &ldquo;LOGIN&rdquo; (without entering any information) and then click &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have a login? Click here to sign up today.&rdquo; </li>
</ul>
<p>You will then be prompted to complete your identifying account information. Once your account is recognized, you will be prompted to create a password that meets the security requirements of our new online banking platform. You will then be prompted to set up your security questions. There are numerous options of questions for you to choose from. You must specify three questions to use. Your answers to each question must be at least six characters with zero spaces. If your answer to one of the questions is not six characters long, you can either choose a different question or repeat your answer twice (with zero spaces). (Ex: What is your favorite color? redred) All answers are case sensitive. </p>
<p>Once your log in credentials are set up, you should be able to access your accounts via Online Banking AND Mobile Banking as your new log in credentials will automatically transfer to the new CGR Credit Union Mobile Banking application (see below for further details). </p>
<p>Please note: If the account identifying information you enter is not recognized by our system, you will receive a message stating your application has been sent to the credit union for processing. You will then be contacted by a CGRCU staff member who will verify that you were attempting to create a log in and help you complete the registration process, or you can call for assistance anytime at 478-745-0494.</p>
<ul>
  <li>As part of the conversion, our <strong>Mobile Banking</strong> will move to an improved platform. Your current log in IDs and passwords will not convert to the new system. <strong>To use Mobile Banking, you will need to uninstall the current CGRCU mobile application from your smart devices and then download the new mobile application from the Apple iTunes or Google Play store (simply search &ldquo;CGR Credit Union&rdquo; to locate the new app</strong>). You will also need to set up a new log in ID and password for Online Banking (see above for details) before you can proceed with Mobile Banking. The log in credentials you create for Online Banking will automatically transfer to the new CGR Credit Union mobile application, so <strong>your log in ID and password will be the same for Online Banking and Mobile Banking. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have downloaded the new application to your smart device, created a new Online Banking log in ID and password, and mobile banking becomes available post-conversion, you can access your accounts via Mobile Banking using the same log in credentials you set up for Online Banking</p>
