<meta name="description" content="Like all credit unions, CGR Credit Union is a not-for-profit financial cooperative. When you join the credit union, you become a shareholder – or an owner – of a very unique financial institution. Earnings above the required reserves are returned to you, in the form of lower interest rates on loans and competitive dividends on savings.">

<p><strong>When  will the merger officially take place?</strong><br>
  The merger is  already official, but the systems will be consolidated on June 1, 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Will any  employees lose their job?</strong><br>
  No. All remaining  GPMFCU employees are being relocated to CGR Credit Union.</p>
<p><strong>Will I  have to change my account number?</strong><br>
  Yes, account  numbers will be updating.  Your new  member number will add &ldquo;30&rdquo; in front of your GPMFCU member number.  For example, if your GPMFCU member  number is 0123, it will now be 300123.</p>
<p>Account suffixes and loan numbers will update as well.  New account and loan information will be  available through online banking as well as any branch location.  Information can be mailed upon request.</p>
<p><strong>What if I already  have an account with CGR?</strong><br>
  GPMFCU members who have a previously established membership  with CGR will keep their current CGR member number.  GPMFCU accounts will transfer over with new  suffixes linked to the current member number.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need to change  my account information with my payroll department?</strong><br>
  GPMFCU members who currently receive their&nbsp;<strong>direct  deposit</strong>&nbsp;in their GPMFCU account should not experience any issues  through the transition.&nbsp; Deposits will begin depositing into the member's  CGR account after June 1.</p>
<p>Members who have <strong>payroll  deduction</strong> set up for GPMFCU accounts will not need to make any changes at  this time.  The amounts will be sent to  the member's CGR account or loan after June 1.</p>
