<p>Important Information About Procedures For Opening A New Account</p>

<p>To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account.</p>

<p>What this means for you: When opening an account or adding a signer to an existing account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, residence address, mailing address, and an identification number from an un-expired identification card with a photo.</p>

<p>We will accept a state issued driver's license, a military identification card, a state issued identification card, a passport, or an employer identification card. At least one piece of identification must include a photo. We may take additional steps to confirm the identity of new members or persons being added to existing accounts, which may include any or all of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Requesting a credit report</li>
<li>Checking a reference from a previous financial institution</li>
<li>Performing a contact process after account is opened</li>
<li>Confirming employment with employer</li>
</ul>

<p>If we cannot confirm your identity using one of the methods described above, we may not open your account, or add a person to your account, and we may block or close your account after it has been opened and follow any other processes as required by law or regulation.</p>
