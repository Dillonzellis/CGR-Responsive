<meta name="description" content="Like all credit unions, CGR Credit Union is a not-for-profit financial cooperative. When you join the credit union, you become a shareholder – or an owner – of a very unique financial institution. Earnings above the required reserves are returned to you, in the form of lower interest rates on loans and competitive dividends on savings.">

<p><strong>CGR Credit Union Debit Card</strong></p>

<p>A CGR Debit Card provides convenient access to your money when you need it.  Each purchase made with the card will be deducted directly from your Share Draft Checking account.  Tracking your monthly spending is easier than ever because each debit card purchase is listed on your monthly draft statement.</p>

<p><strong>With our Debit Card:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>You can use any ATM terminal with the <a href="" data-remodal-target="moneypass">MoneyPass®</a>, <a href="" data-remodal-target="coop">CO-OP®</a> and <a href="" data-remodal-target="sum">SUM®</a> logos</li>
    <li>There is no fee for unlimited use of ATM terminals that your credit union owns.</li>
    <li>You can make six transactions per month with no CGR Credit Union transaction fee if you use your card at other financial institutions*. However, other financial institutions may impose surcharges for the use of their machines.</li>

</ul>
<p>*Up to <strong>6 free</strong> ATM transactions per month with NO backend fee ($1.00 per withdrawal thereafter).</p>

<p><strong>Important Tips to Help Prevent Debit Card Fraud:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Check your monthly statements immediately.  Make sure all payments are yours. </li>
    <li>Periodically check your account balance and transactions, by utilizing online banking, by telephone, or by printing interim statements at the ATM.</li>  
    <li>Contact the credit union immediately if your card is lost, stolen or subject to fraudulent use. </li>
    <li>Keep a record of card numbers, PINs, expiration dates and 1-800 numbers for financial institutions so you can contact the issuer easily in cases of theft. </li>
    <li>Memorize your PIN number.  Do not use your birth date, address, phone number or social security number.  Never store your PIN with your card, and do not make it available to others. </li>
    <li>Keep your receipts.  You'll need them to check your statement.  If they have your account number on them, tear up or shred receipts before throwing them away. </li>
    <li>Mark through any blank spaces on debit slips, including the tip line at restaurants, so the total amount cannot be changed. </li>
    <li>Know your limits.  Many issuers limit daily purchases and withdrawals for your protection. </li>
    <li>Do not use an ATM if it looks suspicious, it could be a skimming device. </li>
   <li> Be wary of those trying to help you, especially when an ATM "eats" your card, they may be trying to steal your card number and PIN. </li>
   <li> Do not give your PIN number to anyone over the phone, often thieves steal the cards and then call the victim for their PIN, sometimes claiming to be law enforcement or the issuing bank. </li>
