<meta name="description" content="Like all credit unions, CGR Credit Union is a not-for-profit financial cooperative. When you join the credit union, you become a shareholder – or an owner – of a very unique financial institution. Earnings above the required reserves are returned to you, in the form of lower interest rates on loans and competitive dividends on savings.">

<p>As part of the conversion, our Mobile Banking will move to an improved platform. Your current log in IDs and passwords will not convert to the new system. <strong>To use Mobile Banking, you will need to uninstall the current CGRCU mobile application from your smart devices and then download the new mobile application from the Apple iTunes or Google Play store (simply search &ldquo;CGR Credit Union&rdquo; to locate the new app).</strong> You will also need to set up a new log in ID and password for Online Banking (see above for details) before you can proceed with Mobile Banking. The log in credentials you create for Online Banking will automatically transfer to the new CGR Credit Union mobile application, so <strong>your log in ID and password will be the same for Online Banking and Mobile Banking</strong>. </p>
<p>Once you have downloaded the new application to your smart device, created a new Online Banking log in ID and password, and mobile banking becomes available post-conversion, you can access your accounts via Mobile Banking using the same log in credentials you set up for Online Banking.</p>
