    <meta name="description" content="Like all credit unions, CGR Credit Union is a not-for-profit financial cooperative. When you join the credit union, you become a shareholder – or an owner – of a very unique financial institution. Earnings above the required reserves are returned to you, in the form of lower interest rates on loans and competitive dividends on savings.">

                <p>Online banking and mobile banking provide you with easy access to your account information, allows transfers between accounts, loan payments and advances, and more whenever and wherever you are. To ensure your accounts stay secure and protected, a new security enhancement will be released soon.</p>

                <p>The update will require users to complete multi-factor authentication (MFA) to sign into their account. MFA provides an extra layer of protection for the user. The user will login with their USER ID and password and then will receive a security code through email that the user will enter to gain access to the application.</p>

                <p>The security update will be implemented soon. To ensure the transition is as smooth as possible, we've created the following guide to help prepare you for the change.</p>
