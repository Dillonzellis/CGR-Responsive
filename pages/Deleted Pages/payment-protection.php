CGR Credit Union offers its members Payment Protection credit life and credit disability insurance through American National Insurance Company.

Credit disability insurance provides funds to help you make your loan payments if you are unable to work because of an illness or accident.

Most members are eligible to apply for credit life and credit disability insurance. Coverage is available for single or joint borrowers, at affordable rates, and premiums are automatically added to your loan payments.

Protect yourself and your family from the burden that could result if you die or become disabled. Payment Protection offers the peace of mind that comes from knowing your financial obligations will be met. Contact us for details on Payment Protection credit life and credit disability insurance.
