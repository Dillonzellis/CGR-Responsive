<meta name="description" content="Like all credit unions, CGR Credit Union is a not-for-profit financial cooperative. When you join the credit union, you become a shareholder – or an owner – of a very unique financial institution. Earnings above the required reserves are returned to you, in the form of lower interest rates on loans and competitive dividends on savings.">

<p>You can arrange to have your payroll, Social Security, pension or any other recurring check deposited directly into your CGR Credit Union checking or savings account. By doing so, you can eliminate the possibility of losing your check and avoid the need to stand in line to cash or deposit it.</p>

<p>Why use Direct Deposit?</p>

<ul>
<li>Safe – Your paycheck is protected against loss or theft. </li>
<li>Worry-free – Now you can be assured that your check is deposited, even when you're away from home. </li>
<li>Saves time – You no longer have to make special trips to the credit union or stand in long lines on payday. </li>
<li>Convenient – No more waiting for the mailman. Your deposits will be made for you automatically, allowing you to set your own timetable for getting cash. </li>
