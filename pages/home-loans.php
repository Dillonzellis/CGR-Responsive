<meta name="description" content="Like all credit unions, CGR Credit Union is a not-for-profit financial cooperative. When you join the credit union, you become a shareholder – or an owner – of a very unique financial institution. Earnings above the required reserves are returned to you, in the form of lower interest rates on loans and competitive dividends on savings.">

<p>Are you looking to purchase or refinance a mortgage?  With the help of Member First Mortgage, CGR Credit Union offers Fixed and Adjustable Rate Mortgages.  We can put you into your dream home or save you money on your current mortgage by refinancing to a lower rate and / or shorter term.*</p>

<p>Our mortgages offer:</p>

<ul>
<li>No cost pre-qualifications</li>
<li>No cost for our closing attorney to review your offer to purchase contract</li>
<li>No State Intangible Tax (Because the credit union is tax exempt, we do not charge state intangible tax which is calculated at $3.00 per $1,000.  On a $200,000 loan, a savings of $600.00 is realized).</li>
<li>Same day approvals</li>
</ul>
