<meta name="description" content="Like all credit unions, CGR Credit Union is a not-for-profit financial cooperative. When you join the credit union, you become a shareholder – or an owner – of a very unique financial institution. Earnings above the required reserves are returned to you, in the form of lower interest rates on loans and competitive dividends on savings.">

	<p><strong>What CGRCU is doing in Response to COVID-19</strong></p>
	<p>We continue to monitor the dynamic coronavirus situation to determine the best course of action to keep our community safe.  With the confirmed case count rising in our area, we have determined our branch service operations will be temporarily limited to protect our members and employees.</p>
	<p>We have begun to reopen the lobby in some branches and will continue to serve members during regular business hours through our drive-thru, online, and by phone.  As a reminder, the following services are available to you to complete day-to-day financial transactions:</p>
