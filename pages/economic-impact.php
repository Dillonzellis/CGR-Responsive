<meta name="description" content="Like all credit unions, CGR Credit Union is a not-for-profit financial cooperative. When you join the credit union, you become a shareholder – or an owner – of a very unique financial institution. Earnings above the required reserves are returned to you, in the form of lower interest rates on loans and competitive dividends on savings.">

	<p>The president recently signed into law the stimulus package known as the American Rescue Plan, which includes $1,400 Economic Impact Payments (EIP) for qualified individuals.</p>
	<p>As of March 16, 2021, we have begun receiving payments.  It is our policy to release the funds as soon as we receive them from the Treasury.  Please note, you may see a ‘pending deposit’ before the funds have been received.</p>
	<p>If you have received direct deposit payments in your CGR account on previous payments, you can expect your payment to come here once again.</p>
	
	<p>Because the payments are issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), we are unable to determine when we will receive specific payments.  You may check the status of your specific payment at the IRS site <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment" target="_blank">Get My Payment.</a></p>
