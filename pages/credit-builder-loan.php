When you join the credit union, you become a shareholder – or an owner – of a very unique financial institution. Earnings above the required reserves are returned to you, in the form of lower interest rates on loans and competitive dividends on savings.">

<p>No credit history?  You’ve got to start somewhere!  The Credit Builder Loan is designed to help you establish an on time payment history to build your credit.  When approved, we place $1,000 in your account on hold for 12 months.  You make payments towards the $1,000 each month, building your payment history, and at the end of the 12 months the money is released to you.</p>
