        content="Like all credit unions, CGR Credit Union is a not-for-profit financial cooperative. When you join the credit union, you become a shareholder – or an owner – of a very unique financial institution. Earnings above the required reserves are returned to you, in the form of lower interest rates on loans and competitive dividends on savings.">
