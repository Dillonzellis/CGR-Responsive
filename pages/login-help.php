<meta name="description" content="Like all credit unions, CGR Credit Union is a not-for-profit financial cooperative. When you join the credit union, you become a shareholder – or an owner – of a very unique financial institution. Earnings above the required reserves are returned to you, in the form of lower interest rates on loans and competitive dividends on savings.">

<p>Your current Online Banking log in ID and password will not convert over to the new system. Once Online Banking becomes available post-conversion, you will need to visit our website at www.cgrcu.org. Next, you need to click &ldquo;LOGIN&rdquo; (without entering any information) and then click &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have a login? Click here to sign up today.&rdquo; </p>
<p>You will then be prompted to complete your identifying account information. Once your account is recognized, you will be prompted to create a password that meets the security requirements of our new online banking platform. You will then be prompted to set up your security questions. There are numerous options of questions for you to choose from. You must specify three questions to use. Your answers to each question must be at least six characters with zero spaces. If your answer to one of the questions is not six characters long, you can either choose a different question or repeat your answer twice.  (Ex: What is your favorite color? redred) All answers are case sensitive. </p>
<p>Once your log in credentials are set up, you should be able to access your accounts via Online Banking <strong>AND</strong> Mobile Banking as your new log in credentials will automatically transfer to the new CGR Credit Union Mobile Banking application. </p>
<p>Please note: If the account identifying information you enter is not recognized by our system, you will receive a message stating your application has been sent to the credit union for processing. You will then be contacted by a CGRCU staff member who will verify that you were attempting to create a log in and help you complete the registration process, or you can call for assistance anytime at <strong>478-745-0494</strong>.</p>
