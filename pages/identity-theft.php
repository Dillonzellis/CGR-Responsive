<li>Work with you to place fraud alerts with the three major credit bureaus.</li>
<li>Assist you in completing an Identity Theft Affidavit and Declaration of Fraud to establish your rights as a victim.</li>
<li>Activate credit monitoring during your recovery to help you watch for additional signs of abuse.</li>

<p><strong>How to Protect Yourself</strong></p>

<p>Never provide personal ﬁnancial information, including your Social Security number, account numbers or passwords, over the phone or the Internet if you did not initiate the contact.</p>
<p>Never click on the link provided in an e-mail you believe is fraudulent. It may contain a virus that can contaminate your computer.</p>

<p>If you believe the contact is legitimate, go to the company’s Website by typing in the site address directly or using a page you have previously book marked, instead of a link provided in the e-mail.</p>
<p>If you fall victim to an attack, act immediately to protect yourself. Alert your ﬁnancial institution. Place fraud alerts on your credit ﬁles. Monitor your credit ﬁles and account statements closely.</p>
