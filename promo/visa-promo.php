<p>Recently, our members have been receiving phone calls from individuals claiming to be from insurance or loan companies.  These individuals are saying the member qualifies for insurance with their company or is eligible to receive a loan if they do exactly as they say.  They request the members online banking log in information, then deposit a check into the member’s account through Remote Deposit Capture.  The member is instructed to take a portion or all of the money out of their account when it clears and send the money to the insurance or loan company.  The scammer tells them they will be covered or receive the loan funds after they receive the money back.</p>
	
	<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> No legitimate insurance company will send funds and require you to send them back.  Also, insurance or loan companies will not request log in information for your account.  You should never give out your personal log in information to anyone.  If you receive one of these calls, do not give them the information they request.  If you have been a victim of the fraud already, contact the credit union and we will reset your online banking information.  You should not send the funds they request under any circumstance.</p>
