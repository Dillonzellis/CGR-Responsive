**A limited time offer and rates do not apply to existing CGRCU loans. Applicants must qualify under CGR Credit Union’s normal underwriting guidelines. Rates shown are lowest rates available and may vary depending on loan type, term, and applicant credit history. The 1.74% APR applies to loans qualifying for the best rate for a 48 month term. Program rates, terms, and conditions are subject to change without notice.<br>
Member should carefully consider the impact of extending the first payment as it will increase the interest paid during the life of the loan.</p>
